-- EMON installer.
--
--   wget -f https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sblndn20/monitoring-app@v1.3.0/setup.lua && setup
--
-- Note the `&&`: without it, a failed wget leaves the PREVIOUS setup.lua in
-- place and `setup` cheerfully runs that instead, installing whatever ref that
-- old copy defaults to. The failure then looks like "the update did nothing".
--
-- Files are fetched individually rather than as a release tarball. NIDAS pulls
-- a third-party tar binary into /bin first because OpenOS has no archiver; with
-- ~30 files that dependency is not worth it, and this way the installer works
-- straight from a tag with no release pipeline behind it.
--
-- MIRRORS: raw.githubusercontent.com is not reliably reachable from inside
-- OpenComputers everywhere. Its TLS handshake is dropped on some networks,
-- which surfaces as "Remote host terminated the handshake" — the connection is
-- cut after ClientHello, so there is nothing the mod or its config can do. The
-- installer therefore probes several hosts and uses the first that answers.
-- Redirect-based mirrors (githack, statically) are deliberately absent: they
-- answer 301 to another host, and OpenComputers uses a bare HttpURLConnection,
-- which refuses to follow a cross-host redirect. wget would save the HTML.
--
-- Unlike NIDAS, this does NOT replace /lib/core/boot.lua or /etc/profile.lua.
-- Those swaps are cosmetic branding and they make an install fragile.
