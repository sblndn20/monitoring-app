-- Hides the difference between the two things that can carry a message between
-- bases in OpenComputers:
--
--   modem  — Network Card (wired) or Wireless Network Card. Wireless reaches 16
--            blocks on T1 and 400 on T2, minus block hardness along the ray
--            (WirelessNetwork.isUnobstructed), and CANNOT cross dimensions.
--            Broadcast on a port; the receiver must have opened that port.
--   tunnel — Linked Card. Unlimited range, crosses dimensions, but strictly
--            1:1: send() takes no address because there is exactly one peer.
--
-- Both deliver as a `modem_message` signal:
--   modem_message(localAddress, remoteAddress, port, distance, ...)
-- where localAddress is the card that received it — which is what lets a reply
-- go back out the same way it came in.
--
-- Neither carries components. Only messages. See CLAUDE.md.
