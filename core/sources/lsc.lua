-- Lapotronic Supercapacitor (kekztech multiblock, component type `gt_machine`).
--
-- Why this reads sensor text rather than the structured getters:
-- the LSC stores its charge as a BigInteger, but MTELapotronicSuperCapacitor's
-- getEUVar() returns `stored.longValue()` — BigInteger.longValue() *wraps*
-- instead of clamping. So getEUStored() (and getStoredEUString(), which is
-- built on it) return garbage once stored exceeds 2^63. The sensor lines are
-- rendered straight from the BigInteger and stay correct. Fixed upstream only
-- in GTNH 2.9 via a dedicated `LSC` component, which does not exist in 2.8.3.
--
-- Rates are small enough to be safe, so those come from the clean getters where
-- available and fall back to sensor text.
