-- Per-buffer rate tracking.
--
-- The net rate is measured from how `stored` actually changes over time rather
-- than from EU IN minus EU OUT. That works for every source (IC2 storage
-- exposes no throughput at all) and it accounts for passive loss automatically.
--
-- Three rings keep memory flat. Each is a fixed number of slots, so an hour of
-- history costs exactly what a minute does:
--   fast   — the live rate, sampled every poll
--   graph  — whatever the user is looking at; its interval is derived from the
--            chosen window, so a 2-minute window means one point per second
--   slow   — the 1-hour average
--
-- The graph gets its own ring rather than a fixed set of scales: one ring that
-- follows the window is both cheaper and lets any window be chosen.
--
-- Precision note: `stored` is a Lua double, so past 2^53 EU its ULP grows to
-- hundreds of EU. That is irrelevant for a rate — the delta over a multi-second
-- window dwarfs it — but it is why exact display uses the string variant.
