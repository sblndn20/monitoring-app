-- Produces three kinds of view, all the same shape so any renderer can show any
-- of them without special cases:
--   * one per configured physical buffer
--   * a virtual "Wireless EU" view per LSC that has wireless mode enabled
--     (the wireless network is not a component — it is only readable through
--     the owning LSC's sensor text)
--   * an "All buffers" aggregate summing every enabled buffer
--
-- Each view carries its own metrics tracker, so the aggregate gets a real
-- measured rate and graph rather than a sum of rounded per-buffer rates.
